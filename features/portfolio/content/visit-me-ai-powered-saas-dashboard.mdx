# The "Naked Link" Problem

There is a massive gap between delivering a service and delivering a product. VISIT ME, a premier creator of 3D virtual tours for real estate, found themselves stuck in that gap.

They were creating stunning, high-definition digital twins of properties, but the delivery method was underwhelming: a simple, naked URL sent via email.

For the real estate agencies paying for these tours, it was a "Black Box." They had no way to organize their portfolio, no insight into who was watching, and zero analytics to prove ROI to _their_ sellers. The user experience felt disconnected, and valuable data was evaporating into the ether.

We needed to stop just sending links and start delivering **intelligence**.

## The Solution: A B2B Powerhouse

The goal was to transform VISIT ME from a service provider into a SaaS platform. I built a centralized ecosystem where agencies can't just "see" their tours—they can manage, analyze, and optimize them.

    </CardHeader>
    <CardContent>
      Standard web analytics weren't enough. We track behavior <em>inside</em> the 3D
      environment—measuring session duration, specific viewpoints visited, and user navigation
      patterns.

## Under the Hood

Next.js gives us the best of both worlds: modern framework features paired with raw, optimized performance. For this project, we used Next.js for the frontend (leveraging server-rendering and edge optimizations where appropriate) while the analytics backend ran on Python, all deployed on a custom VPS architecture for speed and reliability.

### The Challenge: Tracking the "Un-trackable"

The hardest technical nut to crack was tracking user behavior _inside_ a 3D canvas (WebGL). Unlike a standard website where users click links to change pages, a user in a 3D tour stays on the same URL while "walking" through a house.

Standard analytics tools see this as a single page view. We needed to know if they looked at the kitchen or the garden.

I engineered a custom event listener system that hooks into the 3D engine's coordinate system to generate "spatial heatmaps."

```python
# Validates and maps coords into floorplan regions, then aggregates time per region.
class Movement(BaseModel):
  x: float
  z: float
  time: int  # unix milliseconds

class Payload(BaseModel):
  tour_id: str
  movements: List[Movement]

REGIONS = [
  {"id":"kitchen","xmin":10,"xmax":20,"zmin":0,"zmax":8},
  {"id":"garden","xmin":0,"xmax":20,"zmin":8,"zmax":20},
]

def map_to_region(x: float, z: float):
  for r in REGIONS:
    if r["xmin"] <= x <= r["xmax"] and r["zmin"] <= z <= r["zmax"]:
      return r["id"]
  return "unknown"


@app.post("/api/analytics/spatial-track")
async def spatial_track(payload: Payload):
  totals = {}
  for i in range(len(payload.movements) - 1):
    cur, nxt = payload.movements[i], payload.movements[i + 1]
    region = map_to_region(cur.x, cur.z)
    dt_ms = max(0, nxt.time - cur.time)
    totals[region] = totals.get(region, 0) + dt_ms
  return {"tour_id": payload.tour_id, "region_ms": totals}
```

<Accordion type="single" collapsible className="w-full not-prose my-6">
  <AccordionItem value="data-processing">
    <AccordionTrigger>How we process the data?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      On the backend (Python), these coordinates are mapped against the floorplan. This allows us to
      generate reports saying "Users spent 40% of their time in the Master Bedroom," rather than
      just generic "Time on Page" metrics.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="data-privacy">
    <AccordionTrigger>Data privacy & anonymisation</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      We treat session IDs as ephemeral; personally-identifiable information is removed or hashed
      before persistence. We also sample or redact precise positions where privacy concerns are high
      and expose aggregated metrics only on the UI.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="scaling">
    <AccordionTrigger>Scaling & reliability</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Events are enqueued and processed by background workers to avoid blocking the UI. Batch
      writes, idempotent inserts, and retry strategies ensure the system remains resilient under
      load.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## The Impact

The shift from "sending links" to "providing a platform" was a game changer for VISIT ME. The perceived value of their service skyrocketed, turning them from a vendor into a tech partner.

## Conclusion

This project illustrated that innovation isn't just about which JavaScript framework you choose—it's about solving the visibility problem. By using Next.js for the front-end and building a custom analytics engine on a reliable stack, we gave VISIT ME and their clients the one thing they were missing: clarity.

Now, every virtual step a potential buyer takes is a data point that helps sell a home. 🏠
